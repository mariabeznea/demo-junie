## Custom Prompts
```

1. I'm working with Laravel 12 and Laravel Breeze. 

I want to build a groceries shopping app where I can create groceries shopping lists weekly. Start by creating:

- necessary migrations for the groceries for the current user and for this week's shopping
- seeders for these migrations

Run “php artisan migrate:fresh —seed”

2. Generate a CRUD for the GroceriesItem model with new menu item “Groceries Items” in the Laravel Breeze navigation. 

3. Generate a CRUD for the ShoppingList model and ShoppingListItems with new menu item “Shopping Lists” in the Laravel Breeze navigation. 

Display this for the weekly shopping and add ability to add, update the groceries items in the shopping list as a checkbok and also delete them. 
The shopping list should have a UI item to mark it as complete or change its status.  

4. In the Shopping list add the functionality to create and add groceries items on the spot, not only to select from an available list of items. Create this in the UI as well.
```
